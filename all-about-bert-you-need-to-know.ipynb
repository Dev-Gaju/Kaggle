Specifically, we will take the pre-trained BERT model, add an untrained layer of neurons on the end, and train the new model for our classification task.

As a result, it takes much less time to train our fine-tuned model - it is as if we have already trained the bottom layers of our network extensively and only need to gently tune them while using their output as features for our classification task. In fact, the authors recommend only 2-4 epochs of training for fine-tuning BERT on a specific NLP task (compared to the hundreds of GPU hours needed to train the original BERT model or a LSTM from scratch!). \n","\n","2. **Less Data**\n","\n","    * In addition and perhaps just as important, because of the pre-trained weights this method allows us to fine-tune our task on a much smaller dataset than would be required in a model that is built from scratch. A major drawback of NLP models built from scratch is that we often need a prohibitively large dataset in order to train our network to reasonable accuracy, meaning a lot of time and energy had to be put into dataset creation. By fine-tuning BERT, we are now able to get away with training a model to good performance on a much smaller amount of training data.\n","\n","3. **Better Results**\n","\n","    * Finally, this simple fine-tuning procedure (typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of BERT and training for a few epochs) was shown to achieve state of the art results with minimal task-specific adjustments for a wide variety of tasks: classification, language inference, semantic similarity, question answering, etc. Rather than implementing custom and sometimes-obscure architetures shown to work well on a specific task, simply fine-tuning BERT is shown to be a better (or at least equal) alternative.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"68de7ebf","metadata":{"id":"ZEynC5F4u7Nb","papermill":{"duration":0.017173,"end_time":"2022-12-26T14:17:05.529465","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-26T14:17:05.512292","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<a id=\"4\"></a>\n","# **<center><span style=\"color:#00BFC4;\"> A Shift in NLP </span></center>**\n","\n","This shift to transfer learning parallels the same shift that took place in computer vision a few years ago. Creating a good deep learning network for computer vision tasks can take millions of parameters and be very expensive to train. Researchers discovered that deep networks learn hierarchical feature representations (simple features like edges at the lowest layers with gradually more complex features at higher layers). Rather than training a new network from scratch each time, the lower layers of a trained network with generalized image features could be copied and transfered for use in another network with a different task. It soon became common practice to download a pre-trained deep network and quickly retrain it for the new task or add additional layers on top - vastly preferable to the expensive process of training a network from scratch. For many, the introduction of deep pre-trained language models in 2018 (ELMO, BERT, ULMFIT, Open-GPT, etc.) signals the same shift to transfer learning in NLP that computer vision saw.\n","\n","Let's get started!\n","\n","<a href=\"#toc\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"true\" >‚¨ÜÔ∏èBack to Table of Contents ‚¨ÜÔ∏è</a>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"f8bfa418","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-26T14:17:05.565867Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-26T14:17:05.56528Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-26T14:17:12.54467Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-26T14:17:12.543444Z"},"id":"DEfSbAA4QHas","outputId":"c27153c6-a1b4-4648-db1a-51a7f7f64d20","papermill":{"duration":7.001025,"end_time":"2022-12-26T14:17:12.547694","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-26T14:17:05.546669","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Found GPU at: /device:GPU:0\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["2022-12-26 14:17:10.122630: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:142] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 AVX512F FMA\n","To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.\n","2022-12-26 14:17:10.184880: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:937] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero\n","2022-12-26 14:17:10.277436: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:937] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero\n","2022-12-26 14:17:10.278200: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:937] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero\n","2022-12-26 14:17:12.532470: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:937] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero\n","2022-12-26 14:17:12.533261: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:937] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero\n","2022-12-26 14:17:12.533937: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:937] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero\n","2022-12-26 14:17:12.534598: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1510] Created device /device:GPU:0 with 15401 MB memory:  -> device: 0, name: Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB, pci bus id: 0000:00:04.0, compute capability: 6.0\n"]}],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","# Get the GPU device name.\n","device_name = tf.test.gpu_device_name()\n","\n","# The device name should look like the following:\n","if device_name == '/device:GPU:0':\n","    print('Found GPU at: {}'.format(device_name))\n","else:\n","    raise SystemError('GPU device not found')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1d622696","metadata":{"id":"cqG7FzRVFEIv","papermill":{"duration":0.01686,"end_time":"2022-12-26T14:17:12.583104","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-26T14:17:12.566244","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["In order for torch to use the GPU, we need to identify and specify the GPU as the device.
